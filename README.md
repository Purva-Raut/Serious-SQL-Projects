This repository contains Serious SQL- Data with Danny Projects completed by me.

Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner

In this SQL project, I worked on Danny's restaurant database to analyze and derive insights from three key datasets: sales, menu, and members. 
The primary objective was to help Danny understand his customers better, focusing on their visiting patterns, expenditures, and favorite menu items. 
The ultimate goal was to use these insights to enhance the customer experience and make informed decisions about expanding the existing customer loyalty program.
